1. Executive Summary <br>
No tricks here, just good old network sleuthing! This scenario teaches you how to use Corelight’s insight in Splunk to track down the attack chain of a Trickbot infection. You’ll pivot from Suricata alerts to Zeek evidence, finding indicators of C2 beaconing, lateral movement, and data exfiltration along the way. Plus, you’ll see how valuable our HTTP, DNS, SSL, and x509 logs (and more) are for common incident response and threat hunting tasks.

# Question 104 : 
What's the name of the malware family identified by these alerts?

Let's take a closer look at the "ET MALWARE Win32/Trickbot Data Exfiltration" alerts. You'll notice that three of the alerts share a single UID, meaning they all occured on a single TCP stream. What is that UID?
```
index="corelight" sourcetype="corelight_suricata_corelight" "alert.signature"="ET MALWARE Win32/Trickbot Data Exfiltration"
|stats count by uid
```
Answer:CAoNRI62m9CRqS0R2

# Question 105 : 
What is the IP address of the malicious server involved in the alerts for this stream?
Answer guidance: Provide the IPv4 address. Example: 192.168.1.1

```
index="corelight" sourcetype="corelight_suricata_corelight" uid="CAoNRI62m9CRqS0R2"
|stats count by dest_ip
```
