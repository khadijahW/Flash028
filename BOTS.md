Executive Summary:

No tricks here, just good old network sleuthing! This scenario teaches you how to use Corelight’s insight in Splunk to track down the attack chain of a Trickbot infection. You’ll pivot from Suricata alerts to Zeek evidence, finding indicators of C2 beaconing, lateral movement, and data exfiltration along the way. Plus, you’ll see how valuable our HTTP, DNS, SSL, and x509 logs (and more) are for common incident response and threat hunting tasks.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
# Question 102 : 
Most of the alerts are being generated by a single source host. What is its IP address?

-----------------------------------------------------------------
# Question 103 : 
What's the name of the malware family identified by these alerts?
```
index="corelight" sourcetype="corelight_suricata_corelight" "alert.signature"="ET MALWARE Win32/Trickbot Data Exfiltration"
```
Answer:Trickbot
-----------------------------------------------------------------
# Question 104 : 
What's the name of the malware family identified by these alerts?

Let's take a closer look at the "ET MALWARE Win32/Trickbot Data Exfiltration" alerts. You'll notice that three of the alerts share a single UID, meaning they all occured on a single TCP stream. What is that UID?
```
index="corelight" sourcetype="corelight_suricata_corelight" "alert.signature"="ET MALWARE Win32/Trickbot Data Exfiltration"
|stats count by uid
```
Answer:CAoNRI62m9CRqS0R2

-----------------------------------------------------------------
# Question 105 : 
What is the IP address of the malicious server involved in the alerts for this stream?
Answer guidance: Provide the IPv4 address. Example: 192.168.1.1

```
index="corelight" sourcetype="corelight_suricata_corelight" uid="CAoNRI62m9CRqS0R2"
|stats count by dest_ip
```
Answer:103.16.104.83

-----------------------------------------------------------------
# Question 106:
What layer 7 protocol is the traffic in the previous question flowing over that generates the alerts?

Answer:http

-----------------------------------------------------------------
# Question 107:
Taking the UID mentioned in the previous question and searching for it across the index, we see that a corelight_notice log was also generated. What is the number of the MITRE ATT&CK TTP referenced in the notice?
```
index="corelight" sourcetype="corelight_notice"  uid="CAoNRI62m9CRqS0R2"
|table msg
```
Answer:S0266

-----------------------------------------------------------------
# Question 108:
What User-Agent string was sent as part of the Trickbot HTTP requests?
```
index="corelight" sourcetype="corelight_http"  uid="CAoNRI62m9CRqS0R2"
|table http_user_agent
```

Answer: Ghost

-----------------------------------------------------------------
# Question 109:
What is a process name that is repeated within the POST body of these HTTP requests?
```
index="corelight" sourcetype="corelight_http" post_body
|table post_body
```
Answer: svchost.exe

-----------------------------------------------------------------
# Question 110:
Let's look at what happened after the malware was dropped. Looking at Suricata alerts following the Trickbot alert, a popular scanning tool appears to have been used for reconnaissance. What is the name of that tool?
```
index="corelight" sourcetype="corelight_suricata_corelight" | stats values(alert.signature)
```

Answer: Nessus

-----------------------------------------------------------------

# Question 111:
One of the alerts generated by our infected host could result in command execution on a wireless access point. Looking at the response from the remote system, however, it's pretty clear that the attack failed. How many bytes did the target send back to the attacker on this connection?
```
index="corelight" sourcetype="corelight_suricata_corelight" command execution
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c827d01c-4eb0-486a-9a3e-6ec20ad58e40)
Answer: 0
It is assumed that the answer is 0 becuase it says that the attack failed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
# Quesiton 112:
Looking at the layer 7 services used by the infected host after the Trickbot alerts above, we see an SSH connection made to an internal host. What is the IP address of that host?
```
index="corelight" sourcetype="corelight_ssh" auth_success 
|table dest_ip
```
Answer:10.0.0.72
-----------------------------------------------------------------

# Quesiton 113:
What is the PCR (producer/consumer ratio) of that SSH session?
Answer guidance: Round your answer to 5 decimal places. Example: 2.34567
```
	( SrcApplicationBytes - DstApplicationBytes )
   PCR = 	---------------------------------------------
     		( SrcApplicationBytes + DstApplicationBytes )

index="corelight" CLn5mqsd7SVfTn10g sourcetype=corelight_conn 
|table pcr
```
Answer: -0.99593
-----------------------------------------------------------------

# Quesiton 114:
Examining the inferences section of the SSH log associated with that session, one code indicates a behavior that explains the PCR we just observed. Which code is it?
```
index="corelight" CLn5mqsd7SVfTn10g sourcetype=corelight_ssh inferences
```

Answer: LFD
-----------------------------------------------------------------

# Quesiton 115:
The owner of the infected workstation had no credentials to log into 10.0.0.72 over SSH. However, there was another connection between those hosts over HTTP. What attack type was sent over that connection?
